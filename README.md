# KONEK Product Recommmendation

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of AI-driven models and techniques designed for enhancing recommendation systems and data analysis. The project leverages advanced machine learning methods to provide actionable insights and recommendations based on user cart data and industry trends.

## Key Components

### Current Cart Analysis
- **Word2Vec Model**: Implemented to analyze current cart data and find similar products based on semantic relationships in vector space. This model helps in identifying products with similar features and attributes.

### Item Set Discovery
- **FP-Growth Algorithm**: Used for discovering frequent item sets efficiently. This model aligns with existing AI processes to provide computationally inexpensive methods for item set discovery, crucial for generating recommendations.

### Past Cart Analysis
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Applied for analyzing sequential patterns in historical cart data. LSTM helps in understanding user behavior over time and predicting future purchases based on past patterns.
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering**: Utilized to capture user preferences and interactions. This model enhances the recommendation system by learning complex user-item interactions.

### Industry-Specific Analysis
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Employed to generate industry-specific reports and insights. NLP techniques are used to analyze customer trends and patterns, providing merchants with valuable data on generalized consumer behavior.
