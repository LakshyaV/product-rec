# KONEK Product Recommmendation

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of AI-driven models and techniques designed for enhancing recommendation systems and data analysis. The project leverages machine learning models to provide actionable insights and recommendations based on user cart data and past purchase trends.

## Key Components

### Current Cart Analysis
- **Word2Vec Model**: 
  - **Description**: Word2Vec is a neural network-based model that transforms items into vector representations. These vectors capture semantic relationships between items, allowing the model to find similar products by measuring vector similarity.
  - **How It Works**: Trains on item descriptions or attributes to generate dense vector embeddings. Similar items are identified by comparing vector distances in the embedding space and semantic relationships, enabling the recommendation of products with analogous features.

### Item Set Discovery
- **FP-Growth Algorithm**: 
  - **Description**: FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent item sets and association rules from transaction data. It is known for its performance and scalability in large datasets.
  - **How It Works**: Constructs a compact data structure called an FP-tree to represent itemsets. The algorithm recursively mines this tree to find frequent itemsets by leveraging prefix paths. This helps in discovering combinations of items that frequently appear together in transactions.

### Past Cart Analysis
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: 
  - **Description**: LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to learn and remember long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is particularly useful for analyzing time-series data and user behavior patterns.
  - **How It Works**: Uses memory cells and gating mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies in historical cart data. This enables the model to identify trends, seasonal variations, and sequential patterns in user purchase history.

- **Neural Collaborative Filtering**:
  - **Description**: Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) is a model that combines matrix factorization with neural networks to predict user preferences. It captures complex interactions between users and items.
  - **How It Works**: Utilizes neural networks to learn latent features from store-item interaction data. The network processes these features to predict the likelihood of user preferences for unseen items, improving recommendation accuracy.
 
## Next Steps

To further enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of the models and analyses, the following steps are recommended:

### 1. Improve Data Quality
- **Expand Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources such as customer reviews, social media feedback, and transactional logs to enrich the dataset and capture a broader range of customer behaviors and preferences.
- **Enhance Data Preprocessing**: Implement advanced preprocessing techniques, including text normalization, entity recognition, and feature engineering, to improve the quality and relevance of the input data.
- **Increase Data Granularity**: Collect more granular data on user interactions, item attributes, and purchase history to provide a finer level of detail for analysis and modeling.

### 2. Refine Trend Analysis
- **Incorporate Additional Models**: Explore and integrate advanced models such as Transformer-based architectures for sequential data and ensemble methods to improve trend prediction and pattern recognition.
- **Regularly Update Models**: Implement automated pipelines for model retraining with new data to ensure that the models stay current with evolving trends and user behaviors.
- **Enhance Feature Engineering**: Develop and test new features that capture additional aspects of user behavior and item characteristics, such as contextual or situational factors.

### 3. Industry-Specific Analysis
- **Custom NLP Models**: Develop and train custom NLP models tailored to specific industry jargon and customer language to improve the relevance and accuracy of the analysis.
- **Domain Expertise Integration**: Collaborate with industry experts to refine the analysis approach and ensure that the insights generated are actionable and aligned with current market trends.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Create more detailed and customizable industry-specific reports that provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis. Include visualizations and summaries that cater to different stakeholders' needs.

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback loops with users and stakeholders to gather insights on model performance and relevance. Use this feedback to iteratively improve the models and analyses.
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: Regularly benchmark model performance against industry standards and evaluate effectiveness through A/B testing and other performance metrics.
- **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**: Maintain comprehensive documentation and share knowledge within the team to ensure best practices and learnings are disseminated and utilized.
