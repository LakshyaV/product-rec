# AI-Driven Solutions for Interac

## Overview

This project involves the development and implementation of AI-driven solutions in collaboration with the Interac team, focusing on external opportunities using a point solutions approach. The project aims to leverage Interac's KONEK product to bridge the merchant-customer disconnect and enhance the shopping experience through advanced data analysis and recommendation techniques.

## Key Contributions

- **Collaboration with Interac Team**: Worked both online and in-person with the Interac team to formulate AI-driven solutions for external opportunities, employing a point solutions approach to address various challenges.

- **KONEK Product Utilization**: Leveraged Interac's new KONEK product to utilize its quality and rich data for closing the merchant-customer disconnect, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Current Cart Analysis**: Implemented a Word2Vec model to analyze current cart data and search for similar products based on semantic relationships in the product's vector representations.

- **Item Set Discovery**: Applied the FP-Growth model to align with Interac's existing AI processes, developing computationally efficient methods for discovering item sets relevant to consumers.

- **Past Cart Analysis**: Utilized LSTM and Neural Collaborative Filtering models to analyze past cart data, identifying sequential patterns, seasonal trends, and other non-obvious variations.

- **Industry-Specific Analysis Report**: Generated an industry-specific analysis report using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide merchants with insights into generalized customer trends and patterns.

- **Successful Pitch**: Successfully pitched the project at the Interac office in Toronto, demonstrating the value and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

## Models and Techniques

- **Word2Vec**: Used for semantic analysis and similarity search of current cart items.
